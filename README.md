# Li-Fi-simulator
This work is intended to be completed alongside my Optical communication course.
An exploration of signal transmission with light and consequently a Light Fidelity Simulator.
This repository consists of mathematical models, EMF analysis and digital signal structure.
Study on limitations and bandwidth of data transmission using light.
## Todos
1. Create Mathematical models for data embedding in light signal.
2. Build baseline modules for all related signal schemes.
3. Complete a study of common methods and research in this area.
4. Implement Visualizations of all patterns of signal embedding.
5. Create a GUI for simulating LiFi systems.
